# A package that is in charge of managing the scores file.
# The scores file at this point will consist of only a number. That number is the accumulation of the winnings of the
# user.
# Amount of points for winning a game is as follows:
#                                                   POINTS_OF_WINNING = (DIFFICULTY X 3) + 5
#
#
# Each time the user is winning a game, the points he one will be added to his current amount of point saved in a file.
#
#
# Methods:
#   add_score - The functionâ€™s input is a variable called difficulty. The function will try to read
#               the current score in the scores file, if it fails it will create a new one and will use it to save
#               the current score.
